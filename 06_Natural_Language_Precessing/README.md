- Often when performing analysis, lot of data is numerical, such as sales numbers, physical measuremets, quantifiable categories.Computers are very good at handling direct numerical information.
- As humans we can tell there is a plethora of information inside of text documents.But a computer needs specialized processing techniques in order to "understand" raw text data.
  - email / message / website...
- Text data is highly unstructured and can be in multiple languages!
- Use Cases
  - Calssifying Emails as Spam vs Legitimate
  - Sentiment Analysis of text Movie Reviews: Positive/Negitive
  - Analyzing Trends from written customer feedback forms.
  - Understanding text commands, 'Hey Google, play this song'

## 流程

1. 獲取語料
   - 語料，NLP任務研究的內容
   - 通常用一個文本集合作為語料庫(Corpus)
   - 來源，如小說、文本、或可以自行開發爬蟲程式在網路上抓取資料
2. 預料預處理
   - 語料清洗
     - 留下有用的，刪除噪音數據
     - 常見的數據清洗方式有人工去除重複、對齊、刪除和標註等、或者規則提取內容、正則表達式匹配、根據詞性或命名實體識別提取、邊寫腳本或者代碼批處理等。
   - 分詞
     - 將文本分成詞語
     - 常見的分詞方法有基於字符串匹配的分詞方法、基於理解的分詞方法、基於統計分詞方法和基於規則的分詞方法
   - 詞性標註
     - 給詞語打詞類標籤，如動詞、形容詞、名詞等等。通常用在情感分析、知識推理等任務中
     - 常見的詞性標註方法有基於規則、基於統計等方式，如基於最大熵的詞性標註、基於統計最大機率輸出詞性和基於HMM的詞性標註。
   - 去除停用詞
     - 去掉對文本特徵沒有任何貢獻作用的詞性，比如標點符號、語氣、人稱等等。
3. 特徵工程
   - 把分詞表示成電腦能夠計算的類型，一般為向量
   - 常用的表示模型有詞袋模型(Bag of Word)、TF-IDF；詞向量則是wordvec
4. 特征選擇
   - 選擇合適、表達能力強的特徵
   - 常見的特徵選擇方式有DF，MI，IG，CHI，WLLR， WFO
5. 模型訓練
   - 機器學習模型有KNN、SVM、Naive Bayes、決策樹、GBDT、K-means等
   - 深度學習模型有CNN、RNN、LSTM、SeqSeq、FastText、TextCNN
   - 需注意欠擬合、過擬合的問題
     - 過擬合為在訓練資料表現很好，但是在測試集上表現很差
       - 解決方式有增大數據的訓練量
       - 增加正則化想，如L1正則和L2正則
       - 特徵選取不合理，人工篩選特徵和使用特徵選擇算法
       - 採用DropOut方式
     - 欠擬合是模型不能夠很好的擬合數據，解決方式有
       - 增加其他特徵項
       - 增加模型複雜度，比如神經網絡加更多層、線性模型通過添加多項式使模型的泛化能力更強
       - 減少正則化參數，正則化的目的是用來防止過擬合的，但是當模型出現欠擬合的情形時，可以適度減少正則化參數
6. 評價指標
   - 錯誤率、精度、準確度、精確度、召回率、F1-Score
   - ROC曲線、AUC曲線

### NLTK

- NLTK- Natural Language Toolkit is a very popular open source.
- Initially released in 2001, it is much older than Spacy(released 2015).
- It also provides many functionalities, but includes less efficient implementations.

### Spacy 

- Open Source Natural Language Processing Library

- Designed to effectively handle NLP tasks with the most efficient implementation of common algorithms.

- For many common NLP tasks, Spacy is much faster and more efficient, at the cost of the user not being able to choose a specific algorithmic implementations.

- However, Spacy does not include pre-created models for some applications, such as sentiment analysis, which is typically easier to perform with NLTK.

- install

  ```python
  conda install -c conda-forge spacy 
  
  python -m spacy download en
  ```

## Process

### Tokenizations

- Tokenization is the process of breaking up the original text into component pieces(tokens).

  - Prefix: Character(s) at the beginning
    - ex: $ / ( / "
  - Suffix: Character(s) at the end
    - ex: km / ) / . / , / !
  - Infix：Character(s) in between
    - ex: - / -- / ...
  - Exception: Special-case rule to split a string into serveral tokens or prevent a token from being split when punctuation rules are applied
    - ex: let's / U.S.

- Named Entities

  - The language model recognizes that certain words are organizational names while others are locations, and still other combinations relate to money, dates, etc. Named entities are accessible through the ents property of a Doc object.

- Ref

  - [Tokenization.ipynb](https://github.com/TLYu0419/DataScience/blob/master/Natural_Language_Processing/Natural_Language_Processing_with_Python/01-NLP-Python-Basics/01-Tokenization.ipynb)

### Stemming

- Often when we searching text for a certain keyword, it help if the search returns variations of the word.
- For instance, searching for "boat" might also return "boats" and "boating". Here, "boat" would be the stem for [boat, boater, boating, boats].
- Stemming is a somewhat crude method for cataloging related words; it essentially chops off letters from the end until the stem is reach.
- This works fairly well in most cases, but unfortunately English has many exceptions where a more sophisticated process is required.
- Ref
  - [Stemming.ipynb](https://github.com/TLYu0419/DataScience/blob/master/Natural_Language_Processing/Natural_Language_Processing_with_Python/01-NLP-Python-Basics/02-Stemming.ipynb)



### Lemmatizations

- In contrast stemming, lemmatization looks beyong word reduction, and considers a language's full vocabulary to apply a morphological analysis to words.
- The lemma of 'was' is 'be' and the lemma of 'mice' is 'mouse'. Further, the lemma of 'meeting' might be 'meet' or 'meeting' depending on its use in a sentence.
- Lemmatization is typically seen as much more informative than simple stemming, which is whySpacy has opted to only have Lemmatization avaliable instead of stemming.

- Lemmatization looks at surrounding text to determine a given word's part of speech, it does not categorize phrases.
- Ref
  - [Lemmatization.ipynb](https://github.com/TLYu0419/DataScience/blob/master/Natural_Language_Processing/Natural_Language_Processing_with_Python/01-NLP-Python-Basics/03-Lemmatization.ipynb)

### StopWords

- Words like 'a' and 'the' appear so frequently that they don't require tagging as thoroughly as nouns, verbs and modifiers.
- We call these stop words and they can be filtered from the text to be processed.
- Spacy holds a built-in list of smoe 305 English stop words.
- Sample Code
  - [Stop-Words.ipynb](https://github.com/TLYu0419/DataScience/blob/master/Natural_Language_Processing/Natural_Language_Processing_with_Python/01-NLP-Python-Basics/04-Stop-Words.ipynb)

### Vocubulary and Phrase Matching

Identify and label specific phrases that match patterns we can define ourselves.

We can think of this as a powerful version of Regular Expression where we actually take parts of speech into account for our pattern search.

- Rule-based Matching

- PhraseMatcher

- Ref

- [Vocabulary-and-Matching.ipynb](https://github.com/TLYu0419/DataScience/blob/master/Natural_Language_Processing/Natural_Language_Processing_with_Python/01-NLP-Python-Basics/05-Vocabulary-and-Matching.ipynb)

  - https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#section-rule-based-matching

### Speech Tagging

- Parts-of-Speech(POS)
  - Most words are rare, and it's common for words that look completely different to mean almost the same thing. 
  - The same words in a different order can mean something completely different. 
  - Even splitting text into useful word-like units can be difficult in many languages.
  - While it's possible to solve some problems starting from only the raw characters, it's usually better to use linguistic knowledge to add useful information.
  - That's exactly what spaCy is designed to do: you put in raw text, and get back a **Doc** object, that comes with a variety of annotations.
  - In this lecture we'll take a closer look at coarse POS tags (noun, verb, adjective) and fine-grained tags (plural noun, past-tense verb, superlative adjective).
- Ref
  - [POS-Basics.ipynb](https://github.com/TLYu0419/DataScience/blob/master/Natural_Language_Processing/Natural_Language_Processing_with_Python/02-Parts-of-Speech-Tagging/00-POS-Basics.ipynb)

### Named Entity Recognition

- Named-entity recognition (NER) seeks to locate and classify named entity mentions in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as the person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc.
- what if we have several terms to add as possible NERs?
- In this continued lecture, we will go over how to add in multiple phrases as NERs.
- For example, if we are working with a vacuum company, we might want to add both **vacuum cleaner** and **vacuum-cleaner** as PROD (product) NERs.
- 無需提前設定關鍵字，利用人工智能技術自動識別文本中出現的公司名/機構名、人名、職位、時間、地點、品牌、產品及各種自定義實體資訊。
- 應用場景：信息提取，關係抽取，句法分析，機器翻譯，語義理解，知識圖譜，輿情分析，問答系統Chatbot等。

### Sentence Segmentation

- In Spacy Basics we saw briefly how Doc objects are divided into sentences.
- In this lecture we'll learn how sentence segmentation works, and how to set our own segmentation rules to break up docs into sentences based on our own rules.

- Ref
  - [Sentence-Segmentation.ipynb](https://github.com/TLYu0419/DataScience/blob/master/Natural_Language_Processing/Natural_Language_Processing_with_Python/02-Parts-of-Speech-Tagging/04-Sentence-Segmentation.ipynb)

## Text Classification

- Ref:
  - [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR Seventh Printing.pdf)

- Modeling process and evaluation method are equal to the Normal Machine Learning  project.
- The difference is the Feature Extraction method.

### Text Feature Extraction

- Most classic machine learning algorithms can’t take in raw text. 
- Instead we need to perform a feature “extraction” from the raw text in order to pass numerical features to the machine learning algorithm.

- Count Vectorization
  - count the occurence of each word to map text to a number.
- TF-IDF Vectorizations
  - calculates term frequency-inverse document frequency value for each word(TF-IDF). 
  - Term frequency **tf(t,d)**: is the raw count of a term in a document, i.e. the number of times that term t occurs in document d.
  - However, Term Frequency alone isn’t enough for a thorough feature analysis of the text!Let’s imagine very common terms, like “a” or “the”...
  - Because the term "the" is so common, term frequency will tend to incorrectly emphasize documents which happen to use the word "the" more frequently, without giving enough weight to the more meaningful terms "red" and "dogs". 
  - An inverse document frequency factor is incorporated which diminishes the weight of terms that occur very frequently in the document set and increases the weight of terms that occur rarely.
  - It is the logarithmically scaled inverse fraction of the documents that contain the word (obtained by dividing the total number of documents by the number of documents containing the term, and then taking the logarithm of that quotient)
  - TF-IDF allows us to understand the context of words across an entire corpus of documents, instead of just its relative importance in a single document.

## Sentiment Analysis

- In order to use Spacy’s embedded word vectors, we must download the **larger** spacy english models.
- Full details can be found at:**https://spacy.io/usage/models**
- At the command line download the medium or large spacy english models:
  - **python -m spacy download en_core_web_md**
  - **python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg**
- Now that you have the larger models that contain the word vectors, let’s discuss how word vectors are created.
- Many of the reviews had positive things to say about a movie reserving final judgment to just the very last sentence. So even a negative review can highlight positive things.
- Maybe saying oh the actors were really good in this movie but the script was horrible leading to a bad movie.
- That sort of dichotomy within a single review can be really hard for something like Vader to the text.
- And sometimes it takes something more robust like TFA IDF in order to create your own sort of classification

### word Vectors

- Word2vec is a two-layer neural net that processes text. 

- Its input is a text corpus and its output is a set of vectors: feature vectors for words in that corpus.

- The purpose and usefulness of Word2vec is to group the vectors of similar words together in vectorspace. 

- That is, it detects similarities mathematically. 

- Word2vec creates vectors that are distributed numerical representations of word features, features such as the context of individual words. 

- It does so without human intervention.

- Given enough data, usage and contexts, Word2vec can make highly accurate guesses about a word’s meaning based on past appearances. 

- Those guesses can be used to establish a word’s association with other words (e.g. “man” is to “boy” what “woman” is to “girl”)

- Word2vec trains words against other words that neighbor them in the input corpus.

- It does so in one of two ways, either using context to predict a target word (a method known as continuous bag of words, or CBOW), or using a word to predict a target context, which is called skip-gram

- Recall that each word is now represented by a **vector.**

- In spacy each of these vectors has 300 dimensions. 

- This means we can use Cosine Similarity to measure how similar word vectors are to each other.

- This means we can also perform vector arithmetic with the word vectors.

  - **new_vector = king - man + woman**

- This creates new vectors (not directly associated with a word) that we can then attempt to find most similar vectors to.

- **new_vector closest to vector for queen**

- Interesting relationships can also be established between the word vectors

### Sentiment Analysis

- We’ve already explored text classification and using it to predict sentiment labels on pre-labeled movie reviews.
- But what if we don’t already have those labels?
- Are there methods of attempting to discern sentiment on raw unlabeled text?
- VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning) is a model used for text sentiment analysis that is sensitive to both polarity (positive/negative) and intensity (strength) of emotion.
- It is available in the NLTK package and can be applied directly to unlabeled text data.
- Primarily, VADER sentiment analysis relies on a dictionary which maps lexical features to emotion intensities called sentiment scores. 
- The sentiment score of a text can be obtained by summing up the intensity of each word in the text.
- For example, words like “love”, “like”, “enjoy”, “happy” all convey a **positive** sentiment.
- VADER is intelligent enough to understand basic context of these words, such as “**did not love**” as a negative sentiment.
- It also understands capitalization and punctuation, such as “**LOVE!!!!**”
- Sentiment Analysis on raw text is always challenging however, due to a variety of possible factors:
  - Positive and Negative sentiment in the same text data.
  - Sarcasm using positive words in a negative way.

- Let’s explore using VADER sentiment analysis with NLTK and Python!

## Topic Modeling

- Understand Topic Modeling
- Learn Latent Dirichlet Allocation
- Implement LDA
- Understand Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
- Implement NMF
- Apply LDA and NMF with a project

### Overview

- Topic Modeling allows for us to efficiently analyze large volumes of text by clustering documents into topics.
- A large amount of text data is **unlabeled** meaning we won’t be able to apply our previous supervised learning approaches to create machine learning models for the data!
- If we have **unlabeled** data, then we can attempt to “discover” labels.
- In the case of text data, this means attempting to discover clusters of documents, grouped together by topic.
- A very important idea to keep in mind here is that we don’t know the “correct” topic or “right answer”!
- All we know is that the documents clustered together share similar topic ideas.
- It is up to the user to identify what these topics represent.
- We will begin by examining how Latent Dirichlet Allocation can attempt to discover topics for a corpus of documents!

### Latent Dirichlet Allocation

- Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet was a German mathmatician in the 1800s who contributed widely to the field of modern mathematics.
- There is a probability distribution named after him “Dirichlet Distribution”.
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation is based off this probability distribution.
- In 2003 LDA was first published as a graphical model for topic discovery in *Journal of Machine Learning Research* by David Blei, Andrew Ng and Michael I. Jordan.
  - [Latent Dirichlet Allocation](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf)
- Assumptions of LDA for Topic Modeling
  - Documents with similar topics use similar groups of words
  - Latent topics can then be found by searching for groups of words that frequently occur together in documents across the corpus.
  - Documents are probability distributions over latent topics.
  - Topics themselves are probability distributions over words.
- LDA represents documents as mixtures of topics that split out words with certain probabilities. 
- It assumes that documents are produced in the following fashion:
  - Decide on the number of words N the document will have.
  - Choose a topic mixture for the document (according to a Dirichlet distribution over a fixed set of K topics). 
  - e.g. 60% business, 20% politics, 10% food
- Generate each word in the document by:
  - First picking a topic according to the multinomial distribution that you sampled previously (60% business, 20% politics, 10% food)
  - Using the topic to generate the word itself (according to the topic’s multinomial distribution). 
  - For example, if we selected the food topic, we might generate the word “apple” with 60% probability, “home” with 30% probability, and so on.
- Assuming this generative model for a collection of documents, LDA then tries to backtrack from the documents to find a set of topics that are likely to have generated the collection.
- Now imagine we have a set of documents. 
- We’ve chosen some fixed number of K topics to discover, and want to use LDA to learn the topic representation of each document and the words associated to each topic. 
- Go through each document, and randomly assign each word in the document to one of the K topics.
- This random assignment already gives you both topic representations of all the documents and word distributions of all the topics (note, these initial random topics won’t make sense).
- Now we iterate over every word in every document to improve these topics.
- For every word in every document and for each topic **t** we calculate:
  - p(topic **t** | document **d**) = the proportion of words in document **d** that are currently assigned to topic **t**
  - p(word **w** | topic **t**) = the proportion of assignments to topic **t** over all documents that come from this word **w**
- Reassign w a new topic, where we choose topic t with probability **p(topic t | document d)** * **p(word w | topic t)** 
- This is essentially the probability that topic t generated word w
- After repeating the previous step a large number of times, we eventually reach a roughly steady state where the assignments are acceptable.
- At the end we have each document assigned to a topic.
- We also can search for the words that have the highest probability of being assigned to a topic
- We end up with an output such as:
  - Document assigned to Topic #4
  - Most common words (highest probability) for Topic #4:
    - [‘cat’,’vet’,’birds’,’dog’,...,’food’,’home’]
  - It is up to the user to interpret these topics.
- Two important notes:
  - The user must decide on the amount of topics present in the document.
  - The user must interpret what the topics are.

### Non-negative Matrix Factorization

- Non-negative Matrix Factorization is an unsupervised algorithm that simultaneously performs dimensionality reduction and clustering.
- We can use it in conjunction with TF-IDF to model topics across documents.
- Given a non-negative matrix A, find k-dimension approximation in terms of non-negative factors W and H 
- Approximate each object (i.e. column of A) by a linear combination of k reduced dimensions or “basis vectors” in W.
- Each basis vector can be interpreted as a cluster. The memberships of objects in these clusters encoded by H.
- Input: Non-negative data matrix (**A**), number of basis vectors (**k**), initial values for factors W and H (e.g. random matrices).
- Objective Function: Some measure of reconstruction error between A and the approximation WH
- Expectation–maximization optimisation to refine W and H in order to minimise the objective function. Common approach is to iterate between two multiplicative update rules until convergence
- Step
  1. Construct vector space model for documents (after stopword filtering), resulting in a term-document matrix A.
  2. Apply TF-IDF term weight normalisation to A
  3. Normalize TF-IDF vectors to unit length.
  4. Initialise factors using NNDSVD on A.
  5. Apply Projected Gradient NMF to A.
- Basis vectors: the topics (clusters) in the data.Coefficient matrix: the membership weights for documents relative to each topic (cluster).
- Just like LDA, we will need to select the number of expected topics beforehand (the value of **k**)!
- Also just like with LDA, we will have to interpret the topics based off the coefficient values of the words per topic.

## Deep Learning for NLP

- Understand basic overview of Deep Learning
- Understand basics of LSTM and RNN
- Use LSTM to generate text from source corpus
- Create QA Chat Bots with Python

### Introduction to Neural Networks

- We’ve seen how a single perceptron behaves, now let’s expand this concept to the idea of a neural network!
- Let’s see how to connect many perceptrons together and then how to represent this mathematically!

- Multiple Perceptrons Network
  - Input Layers
    - Real values from the data
  - Hidden Layers
    - Layers in between input and output3 or more layers is “deep network”
  - Output Layer
    - Final estimate of the output
- As you go forwards through more layers, the level of abstraction increases.
- Let’s now discuss the activation function in a little more detail!
  - sigmoid 
  - tanh
  - ReLU: ReLu tends to have the best performance in many situations.
- Deep Learning libraries have these built in for us, so we don’t need to worry about having to implement them manually!
- Now that we understand the basics of neural network theory, let’s move on to implementing and building our own neural network models with Keras!

### Keras Basics

- Let’s learn how to create a very simple neural network for classifying the famous Iris data set!
- The iris data set contains measurements of flower petals and sepals and has corresponding labels to one of three classes (3 flower species).
- Ref
  - [Keras-Basics.ipynb](https://github.com/TLYu0419/DataScience/blob/master/Natural_Language_Processing/Natural_Language_Processing_with_Python/06-Deep-Learning/00-Keras-Basics.ipynb)

### Recurrent Neural Networks Theory

- Examples of Sequences

  - Time Series Data (Sales)
  - Sentences
  - Audio
  - Car Trajectories
  - Music

- Cells that are a function of inputs from previous time steps are also known as *memory cells.*

- RNN are also flexible in their inputs and outputs, for both sequences and single vector values.

- We can also create entire layers of Recurrent Neurons...

- RNN are also very flexible in their inputs and outputs.

  - Sequence to Sequence
  - Sequence to Vector
  - Vector to Sequence

- Now that we understand basic RNNs we’ll move on to understanding a particular cell structure known as LSTM (Long Short Term Memory Units).

### LSTM and GRU

- An issue RNN face is that after a while the network will begin to “forget” the first inputs, as information is lost at each step going through the RNN.

- We need some sort of “long-term memory” for our networks.

- The LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) cell was created to help address these RNN issues.

- Let’s go through how an LSTM cell works!

- Keep in mind, there will be a lot of Math here! Check out the resource link for a full breakdown!

- Fortunately Keras has a really nice API that makes LSTM and RNN easy to work with.

- Coming up next, we’ll learn how to format data for RNNs and then how to use LSTM for text generation.

  

### Text Generation With Python and Keras

- Process Text
- Clean Text
- Tokenize the Text and create Sequences with Keras
- Create the LSTM Based Model
- Split the Data into Features and Labels
  - X Features (First n words of Sequence)
  - Y Label (Next Word after the sequence)
- Fit the Model
- Generate New Text Based off a Seed

- **You must read the paper to understand this network!**

- How the QA Bot Network Works

  - Model takes a discrete set of inputs **x1, ..., xn** that are to be stored in the memory, a query **q**, and outputs an answer **a**
  - Each of the **x** , **q**, and **a** contains symbols coming from a dictionary with **V** words.
  - The model writes all **x** to the memory up to a fixed buffer size, and then finds a continuous representation for the **x** and **q**.
  - End to End Network:
    - Input Memory Representation
    - Output Memory Representation
    - Generating Final Prediction
  - Create a full model with RNN and Multiple Layers
    - Input Memory Representation of stories.
    - Use Keras for Embedding to convert sentences **x**
    - **Encoders C and M**
    - **Question Encoder**
    - Output Memory Representation
    - Each **x** has a corresponding output vector **c**
    - In the single layer case, the sum of the output vector **o** and the input embedding u is then passed through a final weight matrix W (of size V × d) and a softmax to produce the predicted label:

## Word2vec

## 簡介
- Ref
  - [Word2Vec Tutorial - The Skip-Gram Model](http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/)

### 原理
- CBOW
- Skip Gram
 
### How to measure word2vec's quality?
#### 內部評價
從模型本身來評估向量的品質
- 相關性（Relatedness）：比較生成的詞向量的詞與詞之間的餘弦相似度和人類評價的相似度的關係。具體的方式會是呼叫與某個詞相似度最高的 K 個詞來檢視結果。

- 類比性（Analogy）：對於一個y，去找到一個x，使得x:y的關係要和a:b的關係一樣。詢問模型A:B 會相當於 C: ??。例如詢問模型中國之於北京，相當於台灣之於什麼，理想的詞向量應該要回答台北。

- 分類（Categorization）：把生成的詞向量做聚類，看聚類是否符合領域的認知(可以搭配一些視覺化的技巧處理)


#### 外部評價
通過下游的回歸或分類任務來評估向量的品質

- Ref
  - [詞向量評估總結與實踐](https://www.gushiciku.cn/pl/g0sC/zh-tw)

### Online-training 再訓練
通過下游任務的語料庫對原先預訓練的向量進行再訓練，可以獲得更適合下游任務的詞向量，藉以提升模型的效度。
但是要進行詞向量的再訓練，需要確保證資料集足夠大，能覆蓋到詞庫中的大部分詞。再訓練時會對原先的詞向量做空間的偏移，導致沒有訓練的詞向量與之存在於不同的詞空間，這樣自然會使得效能下降。
