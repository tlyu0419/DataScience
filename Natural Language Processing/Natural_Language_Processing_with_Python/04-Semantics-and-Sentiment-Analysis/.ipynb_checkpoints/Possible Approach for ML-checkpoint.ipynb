      "at his catholic school , his favorite teacher , sister terry ( rosie o'donnell ) , tries to give him guidance , but this is a journey he must make on his own . \r\n",

      "the nostalgic elements ( best friend , favorite teacher , first crush , etc . ) have been done much better in other movies , and actually seem more like filler here . \r\n",
      "the film's strongest scenes are some touching flashbacks depicting joshua's relationship with his grandfather . \r\n",
      "they show more depth than is present anywhere else in the movie . \r\n",
      "maybe the film would have been better if , instead of playing the relationship through flashbacks , it were set entirely during joshua's last year with his grandpa . \r\n",
      "it certainly would have been more entertaining . \r\n",
