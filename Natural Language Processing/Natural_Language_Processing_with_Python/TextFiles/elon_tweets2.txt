Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin &amp; turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.

Blog on Autopilot by @PeterDiamandis https://t.co/LR5zuw3J9X
@bolayer @SwiftOnSecurity US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
@c4757p @SwiftOnSecurity Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.
@FantaAIex It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience.
@SwiftOnSecurity With less than 1B miles, there simply isn't enough data. 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition.
@nicatronTg @SwiftOnSecurity Thanks. Point of calling it 'beta' was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn\'t perfect.

@stegen @FortuneMagazine you're right, no point

@gdoehne @disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn The Google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.
@disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn In other words, the intended implication is that a driver must remain alert, just as a pilot must remain alert.
@disinformatico @Eddy_Jahn Tesla Tesla Autopilot is named after aircraft autopilot, as it is always expected that a pilot must stay alert.

As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. 2016 is the year of experimentation.
Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck https://t.co/Sa6uCkpknY
Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines
@fucktyler Thanks Tyler
Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
@AstroOrionMK @BadAstronomer Quite rapid... Yes
RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly :)
Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.

Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
Of greater concern: 37 of 40 suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used

Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY\nhttps://t.co/I0QQ2D3BtE
@dfjsteve Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard.
Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
Rocket landing speed was close to design max &amp; used up contingency crush core, hence back &amp; forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping.
Satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee. All looks good.

Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg
@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers.
@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
@mattyteare Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin.

@BValvsRacing It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally.
In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome
@RyanCasburn We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
@SnoozeThroughF1 There will be an optional tow hitch.
@RGspan Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.

@Benzinga I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.

@stunt_penguin @LayOn_OverWhale Stage 1 would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced.
@JimmyVosika Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed.
If speed at stage separation &gt; ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h.
Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude &amp; distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed.
@mbhnyc steel collet
Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing. https://t.co/w007TccANJ
@Uncle_Gus probably
However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing.
Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating &amp; rotating.

Final one: anything launched by a railgun (if you could ever reach ~ Mach 27) would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere
Ion thrusters are great, but have extremely tiny force (photon thruster even less). Must have more thrust than weight or you don't go up.

@alankerlin Hydraulics are usually closed, but that adds mass vs short acting open systems. F9 fins only work for 4 mins. We were ~10% off.
Am super proud of my crew for making huge strides towards reusability on this mission. You guys rock!
Upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid, so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month.
Grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic, but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing.
Didn't get good landing/impact video. Pitch dark and foggy. Will piece it together from telemetry and ... actual pieces.
Ship itself is fine. Some of the support equipment on the deck will need to be replaced...

The flight grid fins look like the ones on this test we did, but larger: https://t.co/gTaURQQeyx
@ID_AA_Carmack No choice. Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim.
@John_Gardi Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign &amp; more data. Maybe flight 21.
Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for 'x-wing' style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll.
Base is 300 ft by 100 ft, with wings that extend width to 170 ft. Will allow refuel &amp; rocket flyback in future.

The gas generator is a small rocket engine that powers the turbopump, which produces 7000 horsepower &amp; weighs 160 lbs
Engines are cycling cleanly w ground pneumatics. Replaced gas generator on engine 9 (center) as a precautionary measure.
Abort was caused by oxygen in ground side TEA-TEB. Upper stage on separate internal circuit, so doesn't face same risk.
Rocket engines are healthy, but cleaning turbopump gas generators will take another day. Aiming for Mon eve launch.
@WilliamShatner Will do. Probably at least a few days. Depends on whether we need to pull the turbopumps.
We called manual abort. Better to be paranoid and wrong. Bringing rocket down to borescope engines ...
If launch aborts, we will bring the rocket down for engine inspection, so probably a few days before next attempt
Increasing helium spin start pressure. Probably &lt;50% chance of passing all aborts, but worth a try. Countdown resuming ...

Even if the answer is only on the order of 1%, we should still take immediate action, as there is only one atmosphere.

Technically, I 'got rich' from Zip2 &amp; PayPal w zero govt anything, then put 100% of that into SpaceX, Tesla &amp; SolarCity.
If consumption is low, then the tax is proportionately low. We should prob not have tax on basic foods &amp; critical meds.
@ponder68 Carbon produced by a @SpaceX rocket flight is roughly equal to one 747 flight. No, we should not be exempt.
Net of gas savings, a Tesla is $550 to $600/month with down payment taken care of by tax credits. Maybe less costly then it first seems.
Yes, am arguing against subsidies and in favor of a tax on the end bad created. Market will then achieve best solution.
Trees are net consumers of CO2, so technically we would pay them money :)
Exactly. Seems crazy to risk the CO2 chemical experiment when we have to find another solution anyway.
Big difference between taxing people and taxing purchases (ie consumption). Much better to emphasize the latter.
@MaxMBerger The collective wisdom of the market is usually (not always) better than the smartest govt regulator.
Me &amp; other private money funded Tesla for first 7 years, got IPO+ govt money for 3, now paid back. Yes, carbon tax would be a better way.
@grayj_ There should be a constitutional amendment to redo the tax code every ten years, just like we do a census.
Weight of scientific evidence. Taxes don't ban a purchase, they just increase cost. Am against bans, except in extreme cases.
Exactly. Better to tax known bad thing and incent desired outcome, instead of subsidizing particular solution paths. Let market decide.
Perhaps. I am in favor of fair, simple taxes that are neutral on most things, incent good &amp; disincent bad.

Improving service and honing manufacturing efficiency are the biggest short term challenges. Not sales constrained.
@annabananastand It can do hands free right now. Being able to text people via voice while driving would be a good feature to add...

@BenToBeWild Yes, we will unveil a fully functional advanced prototype of the Model X -- almost identical to production.
The sheer size of Falcon Heavy is mind-blowing. It could literally send a fully loaded London bus to the moon.
The London Sunday Times created a chart showing how Falcon compares to the Saturn V and Shuttle http://t.co/nJMPtYPd
Just posted a photo http://t.co/eN9xzbfO
@MacDeviant Yeah, we will stream the whole mission realtime with no buffer. You see what we see.
Docking with Space Station now likely to happen in April. Hopefully will look something like this: http://t.co/A2gd9ziC
The most interesting view of the Model X is really with the doors open http://t.co/On77BuiU
Just test-fired the Superdraco rocket engine. Enables launch escape and landing on thrusters. SpaceX.com http://t.co/IJaYVEE9
Um, while awesome in its own way, that was not actually the SpaceX theme song. It seems that irony is sometimes lost in a tweet.
The SpaceX theme song by Total Ghost is just too good ... ooh ooh ooh http://t.co/BuKuopI5

The Model X unveiling will be webcast live on http://t.co/S4ZQwTgq at 8pm on Feb 9th. Most cars are pretty blah. This is not.

Design completed for bringing rocket back to launchpad using only thrusters. Yay. Wings r just dead weight in space.

That said, even though they cause me grief, I would defend the right of shorts to exist. They are often unreasonably maligned.
That's not just paranoia (a healthy trait at times). Tesla really is under massive attack by short sellers http://t.co/PUxAOOm2
Will communicate better in the future. Too many people want us to fail and are willing to twist any bit of news against Tesla.
TSLA down ~$500M Friday, but back up ~$500M today. Sorry for the roller coaster.

Next month is also when our Dragon spaceship docks with the Space Station for the first time. Major pucker factor...
Feb is huge month. Model X world premier and public reveal of our LA design studio on the 9th. Stay tuned for more details.
Just finished Massie's book on Catherine. An amazingly expansive and compelling portrait of an incredible woman. Highly recommend.
@om Respectfully disagree. Larry  made awesome moves last year, which laid the foundation for G+ to kick butt in 2012. He's a stud.

I said *information* weapons for a reason. The bit is mightier than the bomb.
If we are not careful, we will find that knife against liberty's neck. Fate has a great sense of irony. http://t.co/OQ2u1zHQ
We built powerful information weapons to fight enemies of liberty. Now those enemies are largely defeated, but the weapons remain.
@FareedZakaria However, China's real estate crisis will explode in a way that makes ours look puny. They can't hide it for much longer.
@FareedZakaria Yeah, 2012 will be great for the American economy & jobs, as we've mostly dealt with the overbuilt housing crisis.
My first prediction of 2012 has come true: ouch, my head hurts.
World violence being super low is probably counter-intuitive to most people. That's because modern media is a misery microscope.
Here's a happy thought for 2012: world violence is at an all time historical low. Excellent piece by Stephen Pinker http://t.co/gv4MLfQe
Hacked my Tesla charge connector on a small island in the rain last night #whatcouldpossiblygowrong
Not that this really matters. All current rocket tech, including ours, sucks. Only when it becomes fully reusable, will it not suck.
SpaceX has Boeing, Lockheed, Europe (Ariane) and Russia (Proton/Soyuz) near checkmate in rocket technology. End game is all about China.

To be clear, CtG absolutely did *not* bang her horse. They were just close friends who liked to take showers together and spoon at night.
Right mood, scented candles, Barry White singing 'Can\'t Get Enough of Your Love, Baby' and the magic (by that I mean horsef*ing) happens ...
I'm just saying that u shouldn't pass judgment based on one night of passion. Sometimes things just happen and u go with the moment :)
Sew one button, doesn't make u a tailor; cook one meal, doesn't make u a chef; but f* one horse and u r a horsef*er for all of history...
Am reading Robert Massie's book on Catherine the Great. Yeah, I know what you're probably thinking ... did she really f* a horse?
Am not saying that is *necessarily* good or bad, but reality will force us to live with the consequences of our actions http://t.co/fnXmhUok
Interesting Economist article about how humanity's collective actions have created a fundamentally new geological age -- the Anthropocene.
@om Cool personal essay. It really resonated with me, as I felt the same way after coming very close to dying from malaria ten years ago.
@richardbranson Liked 'Screw Business as Usual' a lot. This approach should be taken to heart by all, as it really is the smart move.
@kanyewest Just returned from Haiti. For those who want to help, I recommend donating to MSF, UNICEF and Artists for Peace & Justice.

Just returned from a trip to Haiti. Covered a lot of ground and saw many tough situations. They need a lot of help.
